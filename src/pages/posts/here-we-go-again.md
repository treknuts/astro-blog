# Well Well Well...

Here I go again learning a new web technology to see if it will make me a better developer. I just can't help myself but implement something I see on [Fireship's](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship) YouTube channel. Those damn videos are _way_ too catchy!

I could justify spending time on this, however, for the infamous **Perley Barn Event Center** project. As an undergrad in my Junior/Senior year my father-in-law propositioned me to build a website for a real estate project he was working on. The idea is a wedding venue in rural Minnesota...

The property had an old farmhouse and the stereotypical **big red barn**. After waiting patiently through the pandemic, I finally got to visit the property this week (to provide free labor, of course). Despite my concerns about this project, especially around the intended, I was very impressed. The barn had the roof and siding updated, the shop-house (henceforth reffered to as _shouse_) is immaculate on the exterior, and the upper level of the shouse is **AMAZING**. Imagine 1-level 2 bed 2 bath 2000 sqft slab-on-grade house that is **brand new**.

Regardless of how impressed I was, I still can't help but worry about the profitability of this venture. Here's what I keep hearing

_"I only need to host **6** weddings a year to cover the cost!"_
_"I only need to host **8** weddings a year to cover the cost!"_

I wonder how many weddings will be required to **break even** the next time this project is brought up. Again, that's the number of weddings needed to be hosted to **BREAK EVEN**. You might think, "8 weddings a year isn't that much. They will easily break even over 12 months.

That's where you'd be wrong. Out here in North Dakota/Minnesota, we have 9-month winters. Technically the venue has heat and whatnot, but considering how rural the venue is, roads won't be cleared immediately like they would be in a more metro location if at all. I'm not aware of the zoning of the driveway, but I doubt city or state workers are going to clear that after the multiple blizzards we will have.

Ok...winter aside (which is should be a major consideration), the venue is surrounded by farm land. So, customers likely won't want to have wedding pictures there before or during planting season (April-May). Customers also won't want to be there during harvest (August-September). For those paying attention, prime wedding season for this venue will only be during June and July.

Is it possible that people will have 8 weddings in two months? Sure! Does the fact that there are only 2 viable months give me major anxiety? Also, yes.

Let's be clear. I am not invested in this even a little bit. I have nothing to lose or gain from this project, but this is my family. I want them to be successful, but I can't help but think there will be multiple seasons where this venture loses money.

Why did I mention all of this and what the fuck does this have to do with me learning Astro? Well, now that my life is considerably less chaotic than it was when I was initially propositioned to build their website, I'm considering doing this for them. Astro is cool, fast, and has a great developer experience. Building this useless blog proved that to me. However, I'm not sure I can count on non-technical people writting posts in Markdown, and I **definitely** can't count on them to redesign anything as it's all code. Granted it's just HTML and CSS for the most part, but that still puts every little change on me. I think a traditional CMS may be the way to go for this project if I decide to do it. Since I use Typo3 professionally and it's open-source. That is my top candidate.

Well if someone somehow wound up here, thanks for reading!
