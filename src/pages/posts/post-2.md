After a successful first week learning Astro, I decided to try some more. I wrote and imported a small component from memory!

```java
package com.example;

public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Rust!");
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::count << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
