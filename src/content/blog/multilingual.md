### Hello, World!

Ah! The classic first program written by probably every single person that has even written a lick of code. Here's my _"look how smart I am"_ version of someone that knows about 5 words of Spanish and thinks they're fluent. Here's _"Hello, World!"_ in every language I have worked with. Keep in mind I'm fluent in **_maybe_** one.

#### Java

```java
package com.example;

public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
}
```

#### HTML/PHP

```html
<html>
 <head>
  <title>Hello, World!</title>
 </head>
 <body>
 <?php echo '<p>Hello, World!</p>'; ?>
 </body>
</html>
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val name = "World";
    println("Hello, $name!);
}
```

#### JavaScript

```javascript
document.createTextNode("Hello, World!");
```

#### GraphQL

Not entirely sure how to do this in GraphQL, but here's a stab at it! I'm looking for _ZeepZorp's_ homeworld.

```graphql
{
  user(name: "zeepzorp") {
    homeWorld
  }
}
```

#### Rust

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Rust!");
}
```

#### C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
